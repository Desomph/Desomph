### Hi there 👋

My name is Dejan. I'm a software engineer with ~7 years of experience. Most of the work I've done is privately-repoed closed-source code, but I also contributed to some of the open source libs.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a complex full-stack project for a F500 company.
- 🌱 My preferred tech stack: AWS, Microservice Architecture with Message Brokers, Java, Spring, Typescript, React
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
